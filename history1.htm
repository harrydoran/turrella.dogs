<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/PRINCE LOGIC_f.jpg','640','472','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC00','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/PRINCE LOGIC_t.jpg" width="200" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" class="dispalypic"></a>Alfred James Ouley was only a child when given his first Cattle Dog by 
his grandfather. His first registered bitch was Aust CH Starlight Patsy, bought 
from Mr S Robinson in 1949. He paid fifteen pound for her in pup to Hillsview 
Logic's Successor.    </p>
<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/PATCHES_DAD_lg_f.jpg','320','484','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC00','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/PATCHES_DAD_lg_t.jpg" border="1" align="right" class="dispalypic"></a>Prince Logic was Alf's first registered male whom he also purchased in 
1949, again from Mr S Robinson.</p>
<p>
    Aust CH Trueblue Patches was Alf's best male. Patches dam, Turrella Pride 
was bred by Alf and given to Mr Swinerd of Mascot in exchange for pick of the 
litter. When the time came, Mr Swinerd kept the pick of the litter for 
himself, so Alf had to take second pick, which was Patches (whelped April 23, 1951)
</p>
<p>Alf married Nell and they moved to Sans Souci where they built their home themselves. Nell still lives there today, Alf passed away on 27th Oct, 2008. Patches became a champion within four months 
of showing. He won Best In Show at the Sydney Sheep Show on May 31, 1952 
(only a junior). Nell was not at that show, she was seven months pregnant with me 
(Cheryl).  Next year Patches won Best of Breed at the 1953 Sydney Royal. At 
the advice of Jackie Smith, Patches was retired after that Royal and not show 
again unfortunately until 1957 when he was sent to Melbourne, to Jimmy Stewart 
to help the breed as a stud dog. He was shown down there for only a year, 
where, after winning at Pakenham  and District A.H Society show on March 8, 1958, he 
took ill and despite the efforts of two vets, died at the age of 7.<a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/NEEDLES & ROBIN_f.jpg','510','525','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC00','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/NEEDLESROBIN_t.jpg" width="137" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" class="dispalypic"></a>    </p>
<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/NEEDLES_f.jpg','628','333','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC33','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/NEEDLES_t.jpg" width="200" height="106" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" class="dispalypic"></a>Alf and Nell's best bitch was Aust CHCambridge Needles whelped June 6th, 
1953. She was given to Alf in exchange for a service to Patches. Needles won 
reserve challenge at the 1955 Sydney Royal and Best of Breed at the 1956 
Sydney Royal.</p>
<p>
    The &quot;Turrella &quot; prefix started in 1949, named after the railway station 
in Arncliffe where Alf lived with his parents at the time. Only eight litters 
were bred, Alf and Nell stopped showing in the mid 60's, just like today, Alf 
got fed up with the corrupt judging.
Their last cattle dog was Talaringa Cindi, she was killed in 1970.
</p>

<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/Arthur%20&%20Cheryl%20-2_f.jpg','500','315','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC00','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/ArthurCheryl-2_t.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" class="dispalypic"></a>Alf and Nell's eldest daughter Cheryl married Arthur Edwards in 1971 and 
later moved to Waterfall in 1974 where they still live.    </p>
<p>Our first cattle dog was Aust CH Taits Glen Red Sonny, bred by Joe Tait 
of Bexley (Joe died in 1987). On Alfs advice, Sonny was shown and became one of 
the top dogs in his time, winning two Best In Shows All Breeds and Runner Up 
to Best In Show at the Australian Cattle Dog Society of NSW on 13/9/81 (Mrs 
Bernice Walters of Wooleston Kennels was the judge) and many Best In Groups and 
In Shows. At the time, red cattle dogs were hard to win with.
    Sonny was our foundation dog. </p>
<p>Our first bitch was Meena Melody (red) and 
when put to Sonny we had our first litter in 1979, seven red dogs and one blue 
bitch. We kept the bitch and that was Aust CH Whitefence Blue Tammy.
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('fullimages/CHERYL OULEY & TAMMY_f.jpg','383','442','Turrella Kennels','#FFCC00','hug image','0')"><img src="thumbnails/CHERYOULEYTAMMY_t.jpg" width="137" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" class="dispalypic"></a>&quot;Whitefence&quot; was our first prefix. After two litters my father 
transferred his prefix over to me in 1983.
    We have had many good dogs over the years who have done well in the ring, 
the dogs have won on THEIR MERITS, not like some where the handlers are the 
winners.    </p>
<p>I have been raised with cattle dogs and Arthur and I have been showing 
and breeding for over 30 years. Although we have many good dogs and breed lovely
   puppies, we always aim to improve. 
    So far we have exported 68 dogs to 19 countries and either bred or owned
   66 champions, 1 Int Ch and 2 Grand Champions as well as 4 Obedience titles.
</p>
<p>Countries that we have exported to so far are - New Zealand, America, Switzerland,
  New Caledonia, Philippines, Finland, Japan, South Africa, Kenya, Canada, Ireland,
   Germany, France, Nederlands, Pakistan, Hong Kong U.K., Italy & Peru.</p>
